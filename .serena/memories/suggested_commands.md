# Suggested Commands
- `python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate` – set up a virtual environment once dependencies are known.
- `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` – install dependencies (file to be created later).
- Testing, linting, and run commands are not defined yet; revisit once the codebase exists.
